I am an Assistant Professor in the [School of Economics](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nottingham.ac.uk%2Feconomics%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHTauq0gxeDcjP1drYCxVNEfMsyLQ) and a member of the Centre for Finance, Credit and Macroeconomics ([CFCM](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nottingham.ac.uk%2Fcfcm%2Findex.aspx&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFKeTbW6VpJs_frLTM1jILN8O3fwQ)) and the Centre for Research on Globalisation and Economic Policy ([GEP](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nottingham.ac.uk%2Fgep%2Findex.aspx&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHgVD4MHAHWwkQGnkUQPdVW6fTRLA)) at the [University of Nottingham](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nottingham.ac.uk%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHqAe-nOhDv1-nklEf8y1QiYKdsHw).

In my research, I develop cutting-edge theoretical frameworks disciplined by micro and aggregate data to study Macroeconomic issues. My main areas of interest are growth, development, structural change, and human capital.

I received my Ph.D. in Economics from [Washington University in St. Louis](https://economics.wustl.edu/) in 2020.
